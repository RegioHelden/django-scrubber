# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Finally added some basic tests (thanks [Marco De Felice](https://github.com/md-f))

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: scrubbers that are lazily initialized now receive `Field` instances as parameters, instead of field
  names. If you have custom scrubbers depending on the previous behavior, these should be updated. Accessing the
  field's name from the object instance is trivial: `field_instance.name`. E.g.: if you have `some_field = MyCustomScrubber`
  in any of your models' `Scrubbers`, this class must accept a `Field` instance as first parameter.
  Note that explicitly intializing any of the built-in scrubbers with field names is still supported, so if you were
  just using built-in scrubbers, you should not be affected by this change.
- Ignore proxy models when scrubbing (thanks [Marco De Felice](https://github.com/md-f))
- Expand tests to include python 3.7 and django 2.1
