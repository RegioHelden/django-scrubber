# Django Scrubber

`django_scrubber` is a django app meant to help you anonymize your project's database data. It destructively alters data directly on the DB and therefore **should not be used on production**.

The main use case is providing developers with realistic data to use during development, without having to distribute your customers' or users' potentially sensitive information.
To accomplish this, `django_scrubber` should be plugged in a step during the creation of your database dumps.

Simply mark the fields you want to anonymize and call the `scrub_data` management command. Data will be replaced based on different *scrubbers* (see below), which define how the anonymous content will be generated.

## Installation

Simply run:
```
pip install django-scrubber
```

And add `django_scrubber` to your django `INSTALLED_APPS`. I.e.: in `settings.py` add:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...
  'django_scrubber',
  ...
]
```

## Scrubbing data

In order to scrub data, i.e.: to replace DB data with anonymized versions, `django-scrubber` must know which models and fields it should act on, and how the data should be replaced.

There are a few different ways to select which data should be scrubbed, namely: explicitly per model field; or globally per name or field type.

Adding scrubbers directly to model, matching scrubbers to fields by name:
```python
class MyModel(Model):
    somefield = CharField()

    class Scrubbers:
      somefield = scrubbers.Hash('somefield')
```

Adding scrubbers globally, either by field name or field type:

```python
# (in settings.py)

SCRUBBER_GLOBAL_SCRUBBERS = {
    'name': scrubbers.Hash,
    EmailField: scrubbers.Hash,
}
```

Model scrubbers override field-name scrubbers, which in turn override field-type scrubbers.

To disable global scrubbing in some specific model, simply set the respective field scrubber to `None`.

Which mechanism will be used to scrub the selected data is determined by using one of the provided scrubbers in `django_scrubber.scrubbers`. See below for a list.
Alternatively, values may be anything that can be used as a value in a `QuerySet.update()` call (like `Func` instances, string literals, etc), or any `callable` that returns such an object when called with a `Field` object as argument.

By default, `django_scrubber` will affect all models from all registered apps. This may lead to issues with third-party apps if the global scrubbers are too general. This can be avoided with the `SCRUBBER_APPS_LIST` setting. Using this, you might for instance split your `INSTALLED_APPS` into multiple `SYSTEM_APPS` and `LOCAL_APPS`, then set `SCRUBBER_APPS_LIST = LOCAL_APPS`, to scrub only your own apps.

Finally just run `./manage.py scrub_data` to **destructively** scrub the registered fields.

## Built-In scrubbers

### Empty/Null

The simplest scrubbers: replace the field's content with the empty string or `NULL`, respectively.
```python
class Scrubbers:
    somefield = scrubbers.Empty
    someother = scrubbers.Null
```

These scrubbers have no options.

### Hash

Simple hashing of content:
```python
class Scrubbers:
  somefield = scrubbers.Hash  # will use the field itself as source
  someotherfield = scrubbers.Hash('somefield')  # can optionally pass a different field name as hashing source
```

Currently this uses the MD5 hash which is supported in a wide variety of DB engines. Additionally, since security is not the main objective, a shorter hash length has a lower risk of being longer than whatever field it is supposed to replace.

### Lorem

Simple scrubber meant to replace `TextField` with a static block of text. Has no options.
```python
class Scrubbers:
  somefield = scrubbers.Lorem
```

### Concat

Wrapper around `django.db.functions.Concat` to enable simple concatenation of scrubbers. This is useful if you want to ensure a fields uniqueness through composition of, for instance, the `Hash` and `Faker` (see below) scrubbers. 

The following will generate random email addresses by hashing the user-part and using `faker` for the domain part:
```python
class Scrubbers:
  email = scrubbers.Concat(scrubbers.Hash('email'), models.Value('@'), scrubbers.Faker('domain_name'))
```

### Faker

Replaces content with the help of [faker](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Faker).

```python
class Scrubbers:
  first_name = scrubbers.Faker('first_name')
  last_name = scrubbers.Faker('last_name')
  past_date = scrubbers.Faker('past_date', start_date="-30d", tzinfo=None)
```

The replacements are done on the database-level and should therefore be able to cope with large amounts of data with reasonable performance.

The `Faker` scrubber requires at least one argument: the faker provider used to generate random data. All [faker providers](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers.html) are supported and you can also register your own custom providers.<br />
Any remaining arguments will be passed through to that provider. Please refer to the faker docs if a provider accepts arguments and what to do with them.

#### Locales

Faker will be initialized with the current django `LANGUAGE_CODE` and will populate the DB with localized data. If you want localized scrubbing, simply set it to some other value.

#### Idempotency

By default, the faker instance used to populate the DB uses a fixed random seed, in order to ensure different scrubbings of the same data generate the same output. This is particularly useful if the scrubbed data is imported as a dump by developers, since changing data during troubleshooting would otherwise be confusing.

This behaviour can be changed by setting `SCRUBBER_RANDOM_SEED=None`, which ensures every scrubbing will generate random source data.

#### Limitations

Scrubbing unique fields may lead to `IntegrityError`s, since there is no guarantee that the random content will not be repeated. Playing with different settings for `SCRUBBER_RANDOM_SEED` and `SCRUBBER_ENTRIES_PER_PROVIDER` may alleviate the problem.
Unfortunately, for performance reasons, the source data for scrubbing with faker is added to the database, and arbitrarily increasing `SCRUBBER_ENTRIES_PER_PROVIDER` will significantly slow down scrubbing (besides still not guaranteeing uniqueness).

When using `django < 2.1` and working on `sqlite` a bug within django causes field-specific scrubbing (e.g. `date_object`) to fail. Please consider using a different database backend or upgrade to the latest django version.

## Settings

### `SCRUBBER_GLOBAL_SCRUBBERS`:
Dictionary of global scrubbers. Keys should be either field names as strings or field type classes. Values should be one of the scrubbers provided in `django_scrubber.scrubbers`. 

Example:
```python
SCRUBBER_GLOBAL_SCRUBBERS = {
    'name': scrubbers.Hash,
    EmailField: scrubbers.Hash,
}
```

### `SCRUBBER_RANDOM_SEED`:
The seed used when generating random content by the Faker scrubber. Setting this to `None` means each scrubbing will generate different data.

(default: 42)

### `SCRUBBER_ENTRIES_PER_PROVIDER`:
Number of entries to use as source for Faker scrubber. Increasing this value will increase the randomness of generated data, but decrease performance. 

(default: 1000)

### `SCRUBBER_SKIP_UNMANAGED`:
Do not attempt to scrub models which are not managed by the ORM.

(default: True)

### `SCRUBBER_APPS_LIST`:
Only scrub models belonging to these specific django apps. If unset, will scrub all installed apps.

(default: None)

### `SCRUBBER_ADDITIONAL_FAKER_PROVIDERS`:
Add additional fake providers to be used by Faker. Must be noted as full dotted path to the provider class.

(default: empty list) 

## Logging

Scrubber uses the default django logger. The logger name is ``django_scrubber.scrubbers``. 
So if you want to log - for example - to the console, you could set up the logger like this:

````
LOGGING['loggers']['django_scrubber'] = {
    'handlers': ['console'],
    'propagate': True,
    'level': 'DEBUG',
}
````

## Making a new release

[bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) is used to manage releases.

Add your changes to the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) and run `bumpversion <major|minor|patch>`, then push (including tags)
